**Shorten-url**

A URL Shortener web application built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS. It allows users to generate short, shareable links from long URLs and redirects users to the original link when the short URL is accessed. The application uses server-side rendering and provides a clean, minimal interface for user interaction.

**How It Works**

The user enters a long URL.

A unique short code is generated and stored in the database along with the original URL.

The user receives a shortened version of the URL.

When someone accesses the short URL, the server looks it up and redirects to the original URL.
